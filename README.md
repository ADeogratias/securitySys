Banks in Rwanda face a problem of sometimes receiving their customer’s complaints about frauds. Customers come to the bank saying that they have a report proving that someone sent money on their account, but they haven’t been communicated about it. While on the other hand, the report slips are fake.  The payment has never been completed, and at times the customer is unable to check if the slips are original or not. It is also not easy to leave their shops and jobs to go double-check if truly someone completed a payment.

  #### QR Code Scanning Page####

      The QR code printed on the report slip provided to the client after completing a payment.
      Scanning the QR codes returns details of that payment if the payment is truly part of the system. 
      Otherwise, the system tells you that your QR codes are not known to the system.
